
UAT FRAMEWORK - PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
=======================================

KEY FINDINGS:
• Optimal k_early parameter: 0.8500
• Sound horizon reduction: 21.68%
• Early universe density modification: -15.00%
• Hubble constant maintained: H₀ = 73.04 km/s/Mpc

STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT:
• ΛCDM Optimal χ²: 2334.949
• UAT Solution χ²: 1128.586
• Improvement: Δχ² = +1206.36

PHYSICAL MECHANISM:
The UAT framework modifies early universe expansion history
through Loop Quantum Gravity inspired corrections, resulting
in natural sound horizon reduction compatible with higher
H₀ values from local distance ladder measurements.

CONCLUSION:
UAT represents a viable physically motivated solution to
the Hubble tension, providing testable predictions for
future cosmological surveys.
